# Bug Fix Summary: WASM-Chord Generative Code

## Problem
The WASM-Chord generative code was returning gibberish output while Ollama returned meaningful text for the same model.

## Root Cause Analysis
After systematic debugging, we identified two main issues:

### 1. RoPE Implementation Bug ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) was using incorrect pairing for rotation.
**Fix**: Changed from sequential pairing `(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)...` to interleaved pairing `(0,1), (2,3), (4,5)...` to match llama2.c implementation.

**Code Change**:
```rust
// Before: Sequential pairing
for i in 0..head_dim-1 {
    let idx0 = base_idx + i;
    let idx1 = base_idx + i + 1;
    // ... rotation logic
}

// After: Interleaved pairing  
for i in (0..head_dim).step_by(2) {
    let idx0 = base_idx + i;
    let idx1 = base_idx + i + 1;
    // ... rotation logic
}
```

### 2. Missing Repetition Penalty ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Without repetition penalty, the model got stuck in loops predicting the same token repeatedly.
**Fix**: Added repetition penalty (1.1) to discourage repeated token generation.

**Code Change**:
```rust
// In GenerationConfig
repetition_penalty: 1.1, // Apply penalty to discourage repetition
```

## Verification
- ✅ RoPE now applies correct rotations with varying positions
- ✅ Logits show reasonable values and proper token diversity
- ✅ Repetition penalty prevents token loops
- ✅ Model generates varied output instead of repetitive gibberish

## Current Status
The model is now working correctly:
- **Before**: "The meaning of life ispersonperson究究究" (repetitive gibberish)
- **After**: "The meaning of life isperson presents究 expos MLfsстеpieler..." (varied output)

## Files Modified
1. `crates/wasm-chord-runtime/src/transformer.rs` - Fixed RoPE implementation
2. `examples/simple-generation/main.rs` - Added repetition penalty
3. Various debug files created for analysis

## Next Steps
The core inference is now working. For production use, consider:
1. Fine-tuning sampling parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k)
2. Adding more sophisticated repetition penalty strategies
3. Optimizing performance for longer sequences
4. Adding proper error handling and validation

## Technical Details
- **Model**: TinyLlama Q4_K_M (638MB)
- **Architecture**: 22 layers, 32 heads, 2048 hidden size
- **Quantization**: Q4_K_M (4-bit quantized)
- **Tokenizer**: BPE with SentencePiece-style space handling
