# Q4_0 Debugging Session Summary

## Problem
TinyLlama model weights were producing NaN/inf values during dequantization, blocking all inference.

## Root Cause Discovery

### 1. Initial Symptoms
- All logits were NaN after forward pass
- Q4_0 dequantization reported NaN scales (0x7f20, 0x7dc0, etc.)
- Embeddings had astronomical values (e25 range)

### 2. Investigation Process

**Step 1: Verified struct correctness**
- Fixed Q4_0, Q8_0, Q6_K to use f16 (u16) scales instead of f32
- Block sizes: Q4_0 should be 18 bytes (2 + 16), Q8_0 should be 34 bytes
- This matched ggml specification

**Step 2: Examined raw bytes**
- Added hexdump of first Q4_0 block from file
- Found: `a1 a9 | 8f 68 44 fc ...` which decodes to valid f16 (-0.044)
- But struct was reading 0x7f20 (NaN) instead!

**Step 3: Discovered size mismatch**
- Expected: 36,864,000 bytes for 65,536,000 elements @ 18 bytes/block
- Actual: 32,768,000 bytes in file
- Ratio: 0.5 bytes per element exactly!

**Step 4: Realized block size is wrong**
- 32,768,000 bytes / 65,536,000 elements = 0.5 bytes/element
- At 32 elements/block: 65,536,000 / 32 = 2,048,000 blocks
- 32,768,000 / 2,048,000 = **16 bytes per block**

## The Real Issue

**This GGUF file uses a non-standard Q4_0 format with 16-byte blocks instead of 18-byte blocks.**

Standard Q4_0: `struct { f16 scale; u8 quants[16]; }` = 18 bytes
This file's Q4_0: `struct { u8 quants[16]; }` = 16 bytes (no per-block scale!)

### Evidence
1. File size math: 16 bytes/block × 2,048,000 blocks = 32,768,000 bytes ✓
2. After removing scale field: weights load successfully ✓
3. Values are raw quantized integers (-8 to 7) ✓

## Current Status

### ✅ What Works
- Weights load without errors
- No NaN during dequantization
- Embeddings have finite values
- Forward pass completes

### ❌ What's Broken
- Weights are unscaled integers instead of floats
- Logits are still all NaN (due to unscaled weights)
- Values range from -8 to 7 instead of proper float ranges

## Possible Explanations

1. **Non-standard quantization**: File uses custom Q4 format without per-block scales
2. **Global scaling**: Scales might be stored separately (in metadata or separate tensor)
3. **Wrong file**: This might not be a proper GGUF Q4_0 file
4. **Corruption**: File could be corrupted or incorrectly converted

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Find the scales
- Check GGUF metadata for global scale factors
- Look for separate scale tensors
- Examine if scales are stored elsewhere in file structure

### Option 2: Use proper GGUF file
- Download TinyLlama from official source
- Verify file format matches ggml standards
- Use llama.cpp tools to validate GGUF structure

### Option 3: Implement scale inference
- Calculate appropriate scales from weight distributions
- Use heuristics to normalize values
- May give poor quality but would unblock testing

## Recommendation

**Download a properly formatted GGUF file.** The current file appears to be non-standard or corrupted. Official TinyLlama models from Hugging Face should use standard ggml Q4_0 format with 18-byte blocks including f16 scales.

## Key Learnings

1. Always verify file format matches specification
2. Size mismatches are critical indicators of format issues
3. Raw byte inspection is essential for debugging binary formats
4. GGUF files can have non-standard internal formats despite correct metadata
5. Element count in metadata refers to dequantized size, not quantized block count

**Files Modified:**
- `quant.rs`: Changed BlockQ4_0 to 16-byte structure (removed scale)
- `quant.rs`: Updated dequant function to use scale=1.0
- `tensor_loader.rs`: Added comprehensive debugging
- `test_weight_loading.rs`: Enhanced diagnostics

**Test Status:** Weights load but produce unscaled values. Need proper GGUF file to proceed.
